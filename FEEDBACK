<arjanb> hi, I have some quick comments on your OBT submission:
<arjanb> The O in section 2 seems out of place: capital letter suggest morphism, and O is not mention anywhere later
<arjanb> I would use a different set of letters for the nodes and arrows, eg. C vs c is confusing
<arjanb> What phi means could better be moved to section 2
<arjanb> Some diagrams seems to contain too many blue things
<arjanb> The diagrams are too small for the subscripts to be readable
<arjanb> Maybe footnote 2 could better be integrated into the text of section 2
<arjanb> I would not put agda code in a 2 page abstract, and just keep explaining it in category theory terms
<arjanb> I think most of section 4 could be moved into the introduction
